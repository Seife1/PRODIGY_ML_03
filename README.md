# Image Classification Using SVM with PCA
## Project Overview:
This project performs image classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The data used consists of images of cats and dogs, obtained from the Kaggle competition "Dogs vs Cats". The SVM algorithm is coupled with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the image data, allowing for faster computation and more efficient training.

### Dataset:
* Source: Kaggle's "Dogs vs Cats" dataset
* Total Images: 25,000 (12,500 images each of cats and dogs)
* The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

### Project Workflow:
* Data Preparation:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Data Preprocessing:
* Batch Processing:
* PCA & Dimensionality Reduction:
* Model Training:
* Model Evaluation:

### Key Dependencies:
* Libraries: `pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, PIL, skimage`
* Google Colab: The project leverages Google Colab for data storage and computation.
* Kaggle API: Used to download the dataset.
Results:
The model effectively classifies images of cats and dogs.
